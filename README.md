Code for testing the implementation of an "Ontological Term Broker" 

<http://neurocommons.org/page/Ontological_term_broker>

Eventually, separate packages will be created for (a) the design docs themselves, and (b) the code for an initial implementation.

At the moment, the code for an initial test implementation is available through public SVN, 

<http://svn.neurocommons.org/svn/trunk/broker/>
